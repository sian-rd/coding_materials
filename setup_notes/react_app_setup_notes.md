# Setting Up and Running React Apps


We will use the tool Vite to create our React Apps. It gives us all the boiler plate code and dependencies to get us up and running, saving us times.

1. In the terminal (in VS code) get into the folder where you want to create your project
2. Run `npm create vite@latest`
3. It will ask you for a name for you project - type it in and press enter
4. It will ask you for the type of application - select 'React' and press enter
5. It will ask you what language you want to use - select 'JavaScript' and press enter
6. It will give you 3 commands, run each one, one at a time
    - `cd [project folder name]` - gets you into your project folder
    - `npm install` - installs all the dependencies required to run the app
    - `npm run dev` - runs the application 

You application is now running. You can ctrl + click the link `http://localhost:5173/` to open it in the browser and in the terminal you will see the server running. You need to leave the server running while you are developing your application, so if you want to run any other terminal commands, you will need to open a new terminal window.
