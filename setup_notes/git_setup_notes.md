# git

## Initialising git locally

Using git we can track changes to our code. We can push the changes up to GitHub to have a remote backup and to share with others.

To initialise git locally:
- MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE CORRECT DIRECTORY
- run `git init` in the terminal
This creates a .git file inside the directory. You only need to do this once per project.

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub desktop is an app that lets us easily manage our changes, as well as pushing them to a remote repo.

Add your new repo to GitHub Desktop by:
- Clicking the downward arrow next to the current repo
- Click 'Add repository'
- Select the folder from your computer

You can now review your changes, add them, commit them with a commit message, and push them to the remote.

To review your repos together you can login to github.com.
